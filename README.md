# vtt-to-srt subtitle converter

A simple python module to convert vtt files to srt files **_with colours_**!

## ❓ Why this fork?

Some streaming platforms use vtt subtitles with colours. (ie. Auvio)

- [upstream](https://github.com/lbrayner/vtt-to-srt) doesn't convert vtt to srt subtitles when there are colours.  
see [issue #2](https://github.com/lbrayner/vtt-to-srt/issues/2) 


- other tools like `ffmpeg` don't work either  
`ffmpeg -i captions.vtt captions.srt`    
see ticket [subtitles: vtt conversion to srt creates an empty output](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9609)


- the library used is `webvtt-py`
it can't convert vtt files with colours to srt files  
see [pull request #39](https://github.com/glut23/webvtt-py/pull/39)
